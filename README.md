Electron app and related Arduino sketches for React JS meetup

## Electron app

The `electron-app` folder contains a demo application built with Electron + React.
It connects to the Arduino Cloud, from where it reads some sensors data, which are then
displayed as custom dashboard (like P5.js animations) in the app itself.

## Sketches
The `sketches` folder contains a couple of Arduino sketches used in the demo.
